JSCoreHelper
============

A helper class for accessing JavaScriptCore from Mac OS prior to 10.9


If you ever find yourself needing to integrate with JavaScript code in your Mac app, but you have to support 10.6, 10.7, or 10.8, then you will need something like this.

The methods in this class support installing a script file, adding function callbacks, setting properties, and converting strings.

Feel free to use it, expand it, and fix any leaks or bugs I may have left in there.
